# Fog-Removal-In-Images-Using-RESNET-and-Weighted-Loss-Combination
We use deep learning with RESNET architecture (8 blocks) to restore foggy images. Our weighted loss combination technique optimizes fog removal, preserving details and colors. Superior results over traditional methods benefit computer vision in autonomous driving, surveillance, and medical imaging.
